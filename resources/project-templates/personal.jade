p.project-summary This is a project I decided to do to show off what I've accomplished so far as a web developer.
    | It is also the website you are currently on.

    h2 Learning Objectives and Accomplishments
    p This project was initially about building a polished website that I could use as a portfolio. However,
        | I ended up doing write-ups, what you are reading now, on all of my past projects.
        | This was a time consuming process but it let me stop to self reflect, review some of my code, and
        | acknowledge my weaknesses. By doing this and writing about myself I think I've found
        | a way to keep a clear idea in my head about how to keep moving forward. Really, I've created a
        | resource for myself to use after each project to make sure I've learned as much as I can.
    p More superficially, I've managed to use information from articles I've been reading about#{' '}

            | responsive design
        | #{' '}and#{' '}
        a(href="http://alistapart.com/article/dao")
            | the Dao of web design.
        |#{' '} Stuff that isn't really as technical and more about the philosophy of how to go about
        | working and, as a beginner, recognizing when you could be doing something better.
div.weaknesses
    h2 Weaknesses
    p I can't think of any weaknesses yet, though I'm sure there are many.
        | There are probably quite a few errors in my writing. But I'm taking
        | my time with this one and fixing anything I notice before I move on because I'm not just learning
        | technology anymore, I'm focused on making good content.
