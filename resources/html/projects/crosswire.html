<p class="project-summary">
  With this app users can join playlists made by other users 
  to listen to music together. Everyone adds SoundCloud links
  and controls the room together while crosswire uses socket.io
  to keep everybody in sync.

  <h2>Learning Objectives and Accomplishments</h2>
  <p>
     
    The goal of this project was to build something complete and useful
    and to put it out in the wild with proper security to get an 
    understanding of what it takes to make a product. I picked up so 
    much JavaScript knowledge and got something useful out of it.
  </p>
  <h3>New Technology</h3>
  <h4>Socket.io</h4>
  <p>
     
    I had to get pretty deep into socket.io to make the app work and I'm really
    looking forward to using web sockets for more stuff in the future \(I
    have to make a game now). I was disappointed that the engine was missing
    some basic features, wildcard events and socket lists for rooms, but 
    digging in and adding wildcard events so I could have JWT middlware 
    was actually pretty fun. 
  </p>
  <h4>Testing</h4>
  <p>
     
    In the first iteration of this app I spent several days learning to do 
    tests properly. Mocha and should, the 'default' packages people
    seem to use when they want to test, really didn't fit what I wanted to 
    do and so with the help of some people on IRC, espcially ljharb, I ended
    up using tape and supertest with promises. This solution was awesome
    because combining Promise.map and Array.reduce make it easy to build 
    whatever async control flow one needs.
  </p>
  <h4>Promises</h4>
  <p>
    Learning Promises for testing also ended up being extremely necessary for 
    the socket.io event handlers. Most of them had four or five callbacks
    for database access, authentication checks, or api calls. Thanks to my new
    promise skills I didn't have to build mountain ranges of nested callbacks!
  </p>
  <h4>Security</h4>
  <p>
    Because I was making something for the real world where people use the 
    same password for all of their accounts I knew I had to use SSL. I 
    spent a while figuring out how to make keys and self sign certificates
    to use in my app. I would later learn that I would just use a reverse 
    proxy to handle that stuff and build my app as a normal http server.
    It still helped to have the knowledge for when I did my first deployment
    though.
  </p>
  <h4>Deployment</h4>
  <p>
    I used DigitalOcean for deployment with an Ubuntu VPS. This was a great
    experience thanks to their complete documentation and tutorials for every 
    scenario an admin might have. Even though it was my first time using
    nginx, getting a cert signed, and using PM2 to keep my app up, I got 
    it all done in under half a day. Much relief. I should also mention 
    that I modified my app so that no modification is required between 
    development and deployment in this part. That's probably nothing
    special to someone more experienced, but to me it was very satisfying 
    to be able to pull from github, restart the app process, and have changes 
    go live immediatlely.
  </p>

<div class="weaknesses">
  <h2>Weaknesses</h2>
  <p>
    One of the biggest weaknesses of this app is the large size of the files.
    The client javascript is all in one single massive file. It is organized
    pretty well and could easily be split apart, but I didn't feel I had time 
    to slow down and fix the problems that might cause. In the end I probably
    spent more time scrolling and searching than I would have refactoring and
    my project is a little more ugly because of it.
  </p>
  <p>
    I also found that my ability to sync states between clients isn't that
    great. I did my best to control the state server side and propagate
    changes to the client from the model kept on the server. But, the 
    SoundCloud widget emits events on any modification, even if that 
    modification came from using one of its methods to update its state.
    This means you can't differentiate between primary user events and
    those that come from your server in your event handlers. My solution, to 
    prevent looping updates, was to check if the widget needed the update 
    before applying it. It seemed like a pretty good solution, but it just
    isn't. It actually gives the widget some control of the model and causes a
    mess of bugs/special cases that one has to catch. I think I'll have to
    take some philosophy lessons from flux.js and try to expand my state
    management skills from there because this is a big weakness for me 
    right now.
