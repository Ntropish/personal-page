<p class="project-summary">
  This was the one of the first project I did for FreeCodeCamp.
  It uses Wikipedia's API to search for articles and displays those article's
  titles with some sample text. Clicking on a result sends the user to the article on Wikipedia.

  <h2>Learning Objectives and Accomplishments</h2>
  <p>
    This project was intended to be an introduction to front-end web development. It introduced the use of
    JSON, working in the dom, and user input. All of these are vital skills required to
    do any useful front-end development so it served as a good early project.

<div class="weaknesses">
  <h2>Weaknesses</h2>
  <p>
    As one of my earliest projects There are plenty of weaknesses I could point out.
    There is a little too much callback nesting but overall the structure is okay.
    There are a few console.log()s remaining in the code. Angular could have made this project trivial.
    But, as far as accomplishing the goal of being a front-end introduction it was fairly successful.
