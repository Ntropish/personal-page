<p class="project-summary">
  This app let's a user login to create and vote on polls.
  Any user can visit the page of a user with an account to view their polls
  but must login to vote or create their own.

  <h2>Learning Objectives and Accomplishments</h2>
  <p>The primary objective of this project was to serve as an introduction to back-end development</p>
  <h4>Technology Learned</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <h5>Express</h5>
      <p>
        This was my first time using Express, a web framework for Node.js. Like most things in javascript,
        Express is very open and unopinionated which exposes what is happening to its user at a very deep level.
        Even though this philosophy tends to cause steeper learning curves, I'm very happy that I worked through
        it and can understand why Express is one of the most popular Node.js frameworks.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <h5>MongoDB</h5>
      <p>
        In this project I used Mongoose along with MongoDB for my data storage . These two pieces
        of software made it extremely simple to create a schema and just use it. Other than ease of use, using
        these two caused me to become familiar with the error first callback design pattern and async
        programming in general.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <h5>Authentication and Authorization</h5>
      <p>
        User handling was done with Passport and Express-Sessions.
        It may have actually been easier to just roll my own authentication as Passport seemed to hide
        the inner workings of authentication. However, I'm writing this from the future where I have worked with
        it more. I now know that it is really just an authentication time saver and allows for multiple
        authentication strategies without causing the mess that one would create on their own. Express-Sessions
        is just a middleware that stays out of the way while letting one access user data from any request,
        very useful.
      </p>

<div class="weaknesses">
  <h2>Weaknesses</h2>
  <p>
    This app was structured very poorly and I really disliked working in it after realizing
    everything I had done wrong. It was my first time working with Jade templates. I decided it
    might be a good idea to have route handlers render out html with poll and user data already in them
    using my new templating powers. This caused problems when I wanted to make the client side dynamic
    and resulted in much DOM wrangling. I finished this one up quickly with very little front end
    and almost no styling, wanting to get away from the mess and hoping to use my new Express
    skills for good in the future.
