                | I'm Justin. I enjoy working with JavaScript, and using the MEAN stack to build
                | web applications. I'm fairly new to web development but my past experience
                | in computer graphics and programming are making the learning go by
                | quickly and enjoyably. I've spent most of my teenage years
                | playing in Blender, the open source 3D graphics and animation
                | suite, causing me to use plenty of Photoshop
                | and Gimp, software that is useful for me now in design. I've taken
                | several computer science courses in college, but the
                | majority of my programming experience comes from using python for fun.
                | Earlier this year I set a goal to learn web development because I saw it as one of my weaknesses.
                | However, something I decided to do an a whim has now become the thing I
                | put the majority of my effort into because I enjoy it.
