<p class="project-summary">
  In this project a Pomodoro clock was made. This is a timer for the "Pomodoro Technique"
  in which one works for a set time, then takes a break for a set time before going back t work. So
  in this project a two state timer was built where the state alternates when the timer reaches zero.

  <h2>Learning Objectives and Accomplishments</h2>
  <p>
    The purpose of this project was to improve JavaScript skills in general, but especially around asynchronous
    concepts and user interfaces. I'm really happy with the way both of those objectives were accomplished.
    All of the asynchronous events that happen from user interaction seem to behave exactly how I wanted
    them to, and the clock looks good as far as I know from my up to date version of chrome.

  <h2>Weaknesses</h2>
  <p>
    One thing I was still doing wrong in this project was using divs for buttons. The buttons look nice but
    I know now that behaviors really shouldn't be forced upon elements that weren't made for them. I could
    just as easily use actual buttons and style them the same way now that I know more CSS.
