  <h2>Learning Objectives and Accomplishments</h2>
  <p>
    This project was about making a page look nice, but doing so while getting into hacking. An API did exist to
    grab the current articles, but some analysis of the URIs FreeCodeCamp uses to identify each
    comment page was needed because those links weren't given by the API. Maybe I just needed to
    look harder, but I ended up figuring out how to go from a news article title to a news article comment
    section URI with just a couple regex functions.

    Aside from the hacking and logic fun, this was the first project I used icons in. To avoid cluttering
    the page with lots of identical looking "comments" anchors the best solution seemed to be using icons.
    It ended up fitting in really well for how little effort they took to include.

  <h2>Weaknesses</h2>
  <p>
    In the original FreeCodeCamp news page articles without thumbnails were assigned random ones.
    I decided to use a single placeholder image thinking most articles would have one but looking
    at it right now thumbnails are very sparse. The page is mostly placeholder images and it doesn't look
    very great. I could have also used a gradient on the bottom of images instead of text shadow
    to make the titles pop out and be more readable.
    I'm also still using divs for buttons and links here so I'm ashamed of that. But, overall I could
    have put in just a little bit more effort and made this page look much nicer, which was one of the
    objectives.
