  <p>This project involved making a simple TicTacToe game with an AI.</p>

  <h2>Learning Objectives and Accomplishments</h2>
  <p>
    The primary goal here was to get practice in JavaScript through writing game logic
    and the AI to go with it. I did end up becoming more comfortable with JS and also
    picked up a few tricks for data handling.

  <h2>Weaknesses</h2>
  <p>
    This project could have been made easier with Angular. The game logic has to worry about
    the state of the view, which doesn't separate concerns and made the code harder to reason
    through. Another thing I notice looking back is that my comments aren't sufficient. I'll
    have to improve that in the future.
