  This is a project I decided to do to show off what I've accomplished so far as a web developer.
  It is also the website you are currently on.

  <h2>Learning Objectives and Accomplishments</h2>

    This project was initially about building a polished website that I could use as a portfolio. However,
    I ended up doing write-ups, what you are reading now, on all of my past projects.
    This was a time consuming process but it let me stop to self reflect, review some of my code, and
    acknowledge my weaknesses. By learning to self reflect and write about myself I think I've found
    a way to keep a clear idea in my head about how to keep moving forward. Really I've created a
    resource for myself to use after each project to make sure I've learned as much as I can.
