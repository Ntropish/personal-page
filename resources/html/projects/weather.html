<p class="project-summary">
  The purpose of this project was to create a front-end application that
  would use an api and geolocation to check the local weather. The images
  used on the page change based on the temperature and sky conditions.

    This project was intended to serve as an introduction to geolocation and public
    APIs. I didn't spend enough time on this project or put in enough effort so
    check out the weaknesses section for things learned!

    This project was added just as I was about to finish the last front-end
    challenge in the set at FreeCodeCamp. This was supposed to be one of the first
    an FCC user would complete but I was almost ready to move on to full-stack.
    Because of this I rushed through it and did some things wrongly
    without realizing it. Thankfully, by doing this writeup I can identify
    those things and still learn from a project I didn't put enough effort into.

          First of all, I wasn't sure what all of the possible forecast description
          phrases were so I didn't implement all of the possible sky images. Now
          looking back I realize I can just go check the API documentation and see
          every possibility. A lesson in checking the docs!

          Second, I used Imgur for image hosting. After reading their TOS
          I can see that they aren't okay with this. I'll have to go back
          and fix that if I want to keep the page deployed.

          The last major thing that sticks out is the way I vertically aligned
          that div in the center of the screen. It was supposed to cover the
          seam between the two background images but my poor CSS skills
          made it aligned too high up on large monitors. I did a top: 30%
          thinking it would approximately center it and be good enough.
          This approach isn't really acceptable if the aim is to work well
          on all devices. I should have looked for a better way (like
          top: calc(50% - 5em) ).
