            I'm Justin. I enjoy working with JavaScript, and using the MEAN stack to build
            web applications. I'm fairly new to web development but my past experience
            in computer graphics and programming are making the learning go by
            quickly and enjoyably. I've spent most of my teenage years
            playing in Blender, the open source 3D graphics and animation
            suite, causing me to use plenty of Photoshop
            and Gimp, software that is useful for me now in design. I've taken
            several computer science courses in college, but the
            majority of my programming experience comes from using python for fun.
            Earlier this year I set a goal to learn web development because I saw it as one of my weaknesses.
            However, something I decided to do an a whim has now become the thing I
            put the majority of my effort into because I enjoy it.

            I've worked in three stages for the past eight weeks. The first was to learn the basics.
            This involved reading most of JavaScript: The Definitive Guide and completing the study
            guide found&#32;<a href="http://javascriptissexy.com/how-to-learn-javascript-properly/">here.</a>&#32;The next two portions were working through the exercises on&#32;<a href="http://www.freecodecamp.com/">FreeCodeCamp.</a>&#32;Here, in the second part of my journey, I was directed all the way through being
            able to create front end applications confidently and without guidance.
            For the last stage, the full stack projects, I'm currently working through the last few exercises
            on FreeCodeCamp. I have far less direction than I had previously and am
            having to become more active on Twitter, subscribe to many mailing lists, read blogs,
            and take part in the web development community in order to learn and develop myself further.
